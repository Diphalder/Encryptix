# Task-1 : Number Gussing game
- Ques : Create a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number 
### Explanation:
**Random Number Generation:**
   - The `std::rand` function generates a random number, and the modulo operator (`%`) limits the range to 1-100.

**User Input and Feedback:**
   - The program prompts the user to enter their guess.
   - It provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low.
   - The loop continues until the user guesses the correct number.

### How to Run:
1. Copy and paste the code into a C++ IDE or a text editor and save it with a `.cpp` extension.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler, e.g., `g++ -o Task_1 Task_1_Number_gussing_game.cpp`.
3. Run the executable, e.g., `./Task_1`.

This will start the number guessing game where you can try to guess the randomly generated number.
